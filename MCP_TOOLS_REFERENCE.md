## üí° Tips

- **Search is fuzzy**: Partial names work (e.g., "abhi" finds "Abhijith")
- **Case insensitive**: "slack" and "Slack" both work
- **Multiple identifiers**: Email, user ID, or full name all work for employee lookup
- **Real-time data**: All tools read from the CSV file directly
- **Widget rendering**: All tools (except list_services) render interactive widgets in ChatGPT
