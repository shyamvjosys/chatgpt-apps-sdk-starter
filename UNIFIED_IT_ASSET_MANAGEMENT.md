## 🔗 **Data Cross-Referencing**

### **How It Works**

```typescript
Employee (josys-provisions.csv)
  ↓ Email: abhijith.s@josys.com
  ├─→ Services: Slack (Activated), GitHub (Activated), AWS (Activated)...
  └─→ Devices (josys-devices.csv)
      ├─→ MacBook Pro M2 (Asset: YPMY9WR64R, MDM: Yes)
      └─→ LG Monitor (Asset: 009NTBK1Q397)
      
Compliance Calculation:
  ✓ All laptops MDM enrolled: Yes
  ✓ Has active services: Yes (13)
  ✓ Has assigned devices: Yes (2)
  → Compliance Score: 100%
```

### **Cross-Reference Points**

1. **Email Matching**: Employee email ↔ Device assigned email
2. **Status Validation**: 
   - Deleted employees should NOT have devices
   - Active IT staff SHOULD have laptops
3. **MDM Compliance**: All laptops should be MDM-enrolled
4. **Onboarding/Offboarding**: Track both software AND hardware
